									                 Unit 4 continues to build our knowledge and skills with another codio activity on linters. There is an e-portfolio component on cyclomatic complexity. This is a software metric used to measure the stability, complexity and level of confidence in a program. It is still relevant to the quest of developing secure software because it paves way for testing and maintenace which are key phases of the SDLC</p>

										<h2>End of Module Reflection</h2>
									</header>
									<p>Finally, we have come to the end of the Secure Software Development module with the University of Essex Online. These 6 weeks have not been a joy ride but were full of pressure, learning, commitment and effort. I started the module with a bit of codio knowledge from Launching into Cybersecurity and I am really happy to note the advancement of my skills in python coding due to this module. The team work in our group has been tremendous throughout the 6 weeks. We have helped and taught each other to the extent of having sessions to make sure everyone understands the module. The seminars were also another learning platform that I really valued. It was great to see the tutor providing more detailed explanations as well as learning from other groups through their presentations. 
Being part of a development team was excellent and the journey begins in unit 1 which started off well with a detailed lecture cast. It introduced us well to secure system architecture and design, design patterns and anti-patterns. This is something I fell in love with as I realised that my knowledge in this sector is really increasing. There was also a discussion about coding weaknesses which I posted my initial post. I like how we can also learn from these discussions especially when the tutor gives feedback. The discussion continued on to Unit 2 where we then responded to our colleague’s posts. Unit 2 introduced us to security standards published by ISO/IEC. According to ITgovernance (N.D) ISO 27001 is a framework that helps organisations establish, implement, operate, monitor, review, maintain and continually improve an ISMS. 
Moving on to week 3, it was quite a busy week with the assignment due for submission as well as the other components of unit 3 which needed attention. The assignment needed a lot of work. We all gave each other parts and put in our share of effort. The support and feedback we got from our tutors after our submission was great. It gave us a direction and showed us what we had missed. I remember a zoom meeting with Doug where we presented our code and he gave us valuable feedback about our scope being too big and how we should focus on the core functionality and doable stuff only. As students we have a tendency of wanting everything in the document but our tutors were always there guiding us accordingly. 
Unit 4 had a codio activity of Linters as well as an e-portfolio activity of cyclomatic complexity. It was nice trying out the activities in codio and learning what it is like to code in real life. We also had to explore the range of questions to ask when developing a test plan. A key question I liked was how do users fit into the plan? Incorporating users is always the way to go as they are the end users of the system. 
Unit 5 was interesting as it brought about the future trends. I always find the lecture casts interesting and well detailed that they bring understanding beyond compare. The other exciting part was the codio exercise of creating an API for a distributed environment. I took the codes as a stepping stone into this new industry that I delved into with little knowledge. I liked them because they brought so much real life experience, knowledge and skills that I can use in my future and career. I also liked the fact that we could use the same API coding exercise to gain knowledge and execute it in our final assignment for the module.
In unit 6, the main objective was programming languages covered partially in unit 3.  Of particular interest was the F# language. F# is a strongly typed, functional-first programming language that lets you solve complex problems by writing simple code (Martin Heller, 2018) Combining this with the advice we got from Doug made a lot of sense and made me like the language because of how it produces simple codes based on functionality first. As a team especially in week 5 and 6, the commitment had doubled and we constantly tested our code, had countless meetings to make sure our code works. The session with our tutors to present our code was done and we are happy that our final report shows everyone’s hard work.
All of this put together were moments that I loved about my developmental team. This module has also made me understand the security behind many platforms that we login on the internet daily. It has made me understand the OTPs the security questions and generally I look out for these when I login into any platform to make sure my data is secure. It has also given me understanding of the codes behind the things we see on screen when we visit different pages on the internet. I have become aware of the need to secure my data and visit secure cites only.
