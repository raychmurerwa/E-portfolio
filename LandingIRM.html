										<h2>End of Module Reflection</h2>
									</header>
									<p>Finally, we have come to the end of the Information Risk Management module with the University of Essex Online. These 6 weeks have been full of intense pressure but the knowledge gained is beyond compare. Starting this module in unit 1, I thought that I had a background to risk and it was going to be an easy road. However, as I watched the lecture cast and the readings, I saw that what I knew was very minimal. The lecture cast had a lot of definitions, risk management processes and identification. This progressed on well with the discussion forum on the Spears and Barki (2010) unit 2 reading. This reading was so rich and full of very useful information for our discussion forums as well as unit 3 and 6 assignments. The discussion forum was also a learning platform where the tutors took their time to respond to our initial posts and add more points to what we would have put down. Going through all the posts would provide a lot of information and knowledge.
What I loved about this module was the team work due to the groups we were working with. As we got to unit three, we were supposed to submit our assignment that we had been working on from unit 1. We worked together well and I will not take anything from my team.  By unit 3, my understanding of risk management had drastically changed and I was happy to learn more about SDLC which I was also learning of in the Secure Software Development module. This was a lovely component which made me understand risk in all the phases of the lifecycle. This was carried over to unit 4 where I got more information from the readings and the discussion forum. According to Alexandra Altvater (N.D) SDLC SDLC provides a well-structured flow of phases that help an organization to quickly produce high-quality software which is well-tested and ready for production use. I really loved this concept
Unit 5 was also one of the best weeks with a lot of terms introduced and well explained in the lecture cast. The importance of a disaster recovery plan cannot be over emphasized. This is something that we also had to create in unit 6 assignment. Unit 6 also came with the NSA 5 hard problems is something to continuously take note of. Each of the 5HP sits squarely within the principles of risk, although the concept of risk itself, along with uncertainty, is discussed only implicitly in the 5HP (Scala et al, 2019). I found myself asking a lot of questions, for example is this really the future of IRM?  As a group we discussed and agreed that a lot needs to be incorporated in cybersecurity risk with regards to uncertainty rather than a cost benefit approach or consequence analysis.
Overall, I enjoyed the module. Looking back from Unit 1 up to unit 6, my knowledge and understanding of IRM has really changed and I am in a better position to make sound decisions that make use of the risk matrix, scoring risk and the cost benefit analysis.
