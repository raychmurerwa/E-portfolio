									This is the introductory module which introduced us to the basics of Information security management. Through the lecturecast, I got to understand what constitues a threat and vulnerability as well as roles within the information security profession. We were put into groups which we are expected to work with until the end of the module. A team contract was drafted, finalised and signed and attached below. There was a discussion about the medical mannequin which I also had to read and post an initial summary relating to that. I had to identify threats and vulnerabilities and how these can be mitigated. It was so insightful as it introduced me to various aspects of securing network and information. Take a look at the link below as it takes you to the initial post i made.<br />

											Week 2, we had our first seminar where we had to do a group presenation on the STRIDE and DREAD tools. This was our first assignment ass a group to come up with the presenation. We worked together well and each member was assigned something to do. I attended the seminar and one of our team member presented our slide. Overall it was a good week, I managed to learn more about what STRIDE stands for as well as DREAD. The discussion forum also continued which I responded to two of my peers initial posts. We also had a group meeting to discuss AWS tools and build our website<br />

											By this week end, we had successfully built our website and we were preparing to share it with group one. We had a meeting as a group and we ran tests on our website. We cleared any security issues to make sure that when group 1 does its scans on our website, all issues are sorted. I shared with group one the link to our website. It is at this juncture that AWS started to fail us. As group 4 and on individual level we failed to access group one's website to scan it. Every student had the same problem and we made various reports. However, other aspects of the unit had to go on. Find below my summary post link. <br />

											This week we continued to try to run our websites on AWS but up to no avail. We had a meeting and we discussed the AWS situation. We also analysed some of the scan tools output. With AWS being down, a number of other scan tools were recommended. We tried to run them as a group and also individually, an inititial post in relation to this was posted and the link is shared below.

											This week as a group we have already begun looking at the requirements of the proposal to be submitted in unit 6. Much of our focus is on this proposal. During our meeting we all ran penetration tests and ran some command lines to the website. We also agreed to go with the ecommerce category for our website. I then went on to read and search for more information on the different network tools and components available. The knowledge I have gained so far is interesting on how it is building my skills as someone who did not have an IT background. I love how I have learnt to do scans and interpret some of the reports..<br />

											This week we really worked hard as a group. Communication kept coming through on all our platforms. The main focus was the project to be submitted this week. Our meeting discussed the test reports as well as the draft version of our assignment. We all reviewed our parts and merged it into one. Every team member reviewed the final draft and ammended any part that was necessary since the document was on sharepoint. After an agreement that is well we submitted the project. Apart from the project, a summary of the discussion that started in unit 4 was also required this week. You can find the summary below.<br />

											I am continuing to grow as a masters student in cyber security. The skills I have gained as well as the knowledge I am acquiring from my team mates is amazing. This week, we had a meeting discussing Kali Linux as a requirement for our e-portfolio activity. Kali Linux is interesting to learn as it has over 600 tools already embedded in it. We discussed benefits of Kali over nessus. However, Nessus does not come pre installed on Kali but it can be installed. Therefore Kali Linux is overally better since it can incorporate the other. This week we have also started working on the penetration test to use for our final report.. .<br />

											Our meeting for this week started by discussing our final assignment. Tasks were shared amongst team members and I have to do the conclusion for the final assignment. As a group we focused more on the assignment due in a weeks time. However, the summary for a discussion that started in unit 8 is now due. I have shared the summary. What was interesting to note is that the GDPR fines have increased and this has not stopped the violations from happening. As much as GDPR is very tough, organisations are still being found wanting. Organisations need trainings and more platforms that equip them with more knowledge about the importance of personal data.<br />

											For unit 12, much of the work is on the debate started in unit 11 and finalising our e-portfolios for submission. The seminar held on Saturday also stressed out the importance of a good e-portfolio and what is required. There was a mix up on the requirements for submission, however, it was cleared out after the seminar. Our group meeting was also helpful as we shared experience and members offered help on any any part of the e-portfolio where one felt lacking. Personally I feel I have grown, a lot of work and effort has been put into the module. This is the final unit and looking bad I feel I have gained a lot of extensive knowledge. This unit has also taught me a different perspective on the future of the internet. The various presentations made me rethink what I thought the internet was based on and reconsider the evolutions and the new technologies coming up. Is the future of the internet really changing? Yes it is, with IPv4 running out of IP addresses, this goes to show how much proliferation is happenning. At the end of week 12, we compiled all our minutes into one document below.<br />

										  <h2>MODULE REFLECTION</h2>
									</header>
									
									     <p>Finally, we have come to the end of the Network and Information Security Management module with the University of Essex Online. Throughout the 12 weeks, I have really enjoyed the module. I am really fascinated by the knowledge I have gained as well as the practical experience I also managed to gain which has enabled me to have a different appreciation of computers and the devices around me. Team work was also something I loved about the module. We were put into groups and I was a member of group 4. The way we related as a team in Unit one evolved over time and by the time we got to unit 12 we were like family. Interpersonal and teamwork skills were acquired that I really appreciated.
Looking back from Unit 1 where we started on the basic principles of Network Security, I was a novice in the subject. It welcomed me and gave me meaning of the module that I was embarking on. The medical mannequin case study which was also part of unit 1, was very educative and mind opening. This case study formed 3 important tasks of unit 1, 2 and 3. During these 3 weeks of discussion, I was amazed by how much I can learn from my peers as well as feedback from my tutor. I would like to acknowledge and appreciate the time my tutor put into responding to my posts and those of my peers. His feedback enabled me to gain the critical thinking and analysis skills as well as communication and literacy skills as I would research more so as to answer his questions on his feedback. Over the first 3 weeks, my understanding grew from basic to intermediate level. The learning outcomes of the 3 units were relatively structural. I could identify vulnerabilities within softwares and modern electronic devices. These include missing authentication and authorisation, SQL injections and missing encryption. Stride and Dread was a tool that I learnt to use to evaluate the threats and vulnerabilities. 
By the end of unit 3, I had managed to create my own website on AWS educate account. We also had a group website which we were meant to share with group 1.</p>
										     However, we faced challenges with AWS and these persisted for a further three weeks. I was disappointed as I was enjoying the practical hands on experience I was getting. I wonder how it would have helped to get another educational account that functions just like AWS. We however managed to proceed without much drawbacks on all other aspects of the course.
The following three weeks were the best weeks of the module. Week 4 introduced me to what I had been longing to learn. It was a more practical approach to the module as I learnt what penetration testing is and I had to scan websites using various tools like Ping, Dig, MTR, DNS,Nmap and Whois. It was interesting to learn that the different tools scan different targets. For example, Nmap can show you the geographic location of the target whilst Dig can evaluate DNS name servers. By week 6, we submitted our proposal as group 4. All team members put in their share of ideas and commitment. The team meetings were another thing I looked forward to especially during these three weeks. They were so informative and educative. We could share ideas, knowledge, help and experience.
By week 7, I was no longer a novice. I was proud of myself and how I could scan and perform tests on so many devices even at work. </p>
									In unit 7, a new tool was introduced namely Kali Linux. It’s such an interesting tool and a tool worth using in the industry. My question was why did we wait until unit 7 to learn of this tool. Personally, I think probably I would have abused it since the skills and knowledge were still little. GDPR case studies and issues came in unit eight up to ten. GDPR is a regulating body in the EU which regulates against data breaches. A personal data breach is a breach of security leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to, personal data (ICO. N.D) This is one of the most important aspect in Cyber security. These three weeks had a mixture of practical and literature involved. The case studies raised a lot of issues on directives and articles of the GDPR being violated in everyday life. 
Unit 11, we submitted our final assignment as a group. This assignment was in relation to the design proposal in Unit 6. We managed accomplish all the tests and obligations we had in Unit 6 and even had more tools in unit 11. The final assignment was more detailed with findings, conclusions and recommendations clearly distinguished. We shared tasks and I did the conclusion part of the assignment. We also had a debate in week 11. I loved my topic for debate of how the future of the internet relies on the adoption of IPv6 since I had really enjoyed the topic in unit 3. IPv4 is running out of IP addresses, thus IPv6 should really be adopted with the rollout of the associated security measures to curb the problem. IPv6 has close to 1028 times larger IP addresses that IPv4.</p>
Finally, we came to unit 12 and this is the end of the module. Writing this reflection, I am reminded of the critical reflection skill that I am acquiring through this reflective piece. What an interesting journey. Apart from the educative skills that I gained, I also gained personal skills like time management. Being a full time employee and student is not easy but I managed to complete all the module tasks.
Overall, I enjoyed the module. Personally, I have become more aware of my surroundings and interestingly, I have become more cautious of the applications I use, what data they collect from me, what questions they ask before I submit my data and how secure is the application I am using. The seminars, lecture casts and the e-portfolio component also contributed a lot to my personal growth and development thus giving me the much needed IT and digital skills. The link to my e-portfolio is above and all the artefacts relating to this reflection are in the e-portfolio. I am very grateful for the module and I can use it in my future endeavours. This module is indeed a stepping stone to my qualification and professional career.</p>
