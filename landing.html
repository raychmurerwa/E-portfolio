									This is the introductory module which introduced us to the basics of Information security management. Through the lecturecast, I got to understand what constitues a threat and vulnerability as well as roles within the information security profession. We were put into groups which we are expected to work with until the end of the module. There was a discussion about the medical mannequin which I also had to read and post an initial summary relating to that. I had to identify threats and vulnerabilities and how these can be mitigated. It was so insightful as it introduced me to various aspects of securing network and information. Take a look at the link below as it takes you to the initial post i made.<br />

											Week 2, we had our first seminar where we had to do a group presenation on the STRIDE and DREAD tools. This was our first assignment ass a group to come up with the presenation. We worked together well and each member was assigned something to do. I attended the seminar and one of our team member presented our slide. Overall it was a good week, I managed to learn more about what STRIDE stands for as well as DREAD. The discussion forum also continued which I responded to two of my peers initial posts. We also had a group meeting to discuss AWS tools and build our website<br />

											By this week end, we had successfully built our website and we were preparing to share it with group one. We had a meeting as a group and we ran tests on our website. We cleared any security issues to make sure that when group 1 does its scans on our website, all issues are sorted. I shared with group one the link to our website. It is at this juncture that AWS started to fail us. As group 4 and on individual level we failed to access group one's website to scan it. Every student had the same problem and we made various reports. However, other aspects of the unit had to go on. Find below my summary post link. <br />

											This week we continued to try to run our websites on AWS but up to no avail. We had a meeting and we discussed the AWS situation. We also analysed some of the scan tools output. With AWS being down, a number of other scan tools were recommended. We tried to run them as a group and also individually, an inititial post in relation to this was posted and the link is shared below. I also have shared the link to my scan reports for my individual scans performed..<br />

											This week as a group we have already begun looking at the requirements of the proposal to be submitted in unit 6. Much of our focus is on this proposal. During our meeting we all ran penetration tests and ran some command lines to the website. We also agreed to go with the ecommerce category for our website. I then went on to read and search for more information on the different network tools and components available. The knowledge I have gained so far is interesting on how it is building my skills as someone who did not have an IT background. I love how I have learnt to do scans and interpret some of the reports..<br />

											This week we really worked hard as a group. Communication kept coming through on all our platforms. The main focus was the project to be submitted this week. Our meeting discussed the test reports as well as the draft version of our assignment. We all reviewed our parts and merged it into one. Every team member reviewed the final draft and ammended any part that was necessary since the document was on sharepoint. After an agreement that is well we submitted the project. Apart from the project, a summary of the discussion that started in unit 4 was also required this week. You can find the summary below.<br />

											I am continuing to grow as a masters student in cyber security. The skills I have gained as well as the knowledge I am acquiring from my team mates is amazing. This week, we had a meeting discussing Kali Linux as a requirement for our e-portfolio activity. Kali Linux is interesting to learn as it has over 600 tools already embedded in it. We discussed benefits of Kali over nessus. However, Nessus does not come pre installed on Kali but it can be installed. Therefore Kali Linux is overally better since it can incorporate the other. This week we have also started working on the penetration test to use for our final report.. .<br />

											Unit 8 has a lot going on. I have chosen a case study for my GDPR e-portfolio component. The initial post for this case study is attached below on the link. The GDPR articles and principles seem to be violated more often with organisations doing it willingly and unwillingly. As a group we also discussed GDPR regulations as well as the GDPR security standards preparation. This week there was also seminar 4 which was talking about standards, legislation, and guidelines of information security.<br />

											The lecture cast for unit 9 was on system logging and forensics. The section I loved most was on computer security breaches. We discussed this logging issue as a group. We also started putting much focus on our final assignment. It was also nice to respond to the initial posts of other colleagues. I learnt more about how other aspects of GDPR had been violated in other case studies. I have shared a link to a peer response for a case study I enjoyed the most<br />

											Our meeting for this week started by discussing our final assignment. Tasks were shared amongst team members and I have to do the conclusion for the final assignment. As a group we focused more on the assignment due in a weeks time. However, the summary for a discussion that started in unit 8 is now due. I have shared the summary. What was interesting to note is that the GDPR fines have increased and this has not stopped the violations from happening. As much as GDPR is very tough, organisations are still being found wanting. Organisations need trainings and more platforms that equip them with more knowledge about the importance of personal data.<br />

											By week 11, as a team we have also grown. We now work together efficiently. I loved working as a team and I have learnt a lot from my team members. For this weeks meeting, we reviewed individual sections and corrected them. The individual sections were then merged into one. After reviewing the document, we all agreed it was good and we submitted it. We also have a team debate. Each team has been assigned a topic. I have shared a link to my initial post supporting the topic as required in unit 11.<br />

											For unit 12, much of the work is on the debate started in unit 11 and finalising our e-portfolios for submission. The seminar held on Saturday also stressed out the importance of a good e-portfolio and what is required. There was a mix up on the requirements for submission, however, it was cleared out after the seminar. Our group meeting was also helpful as we shared experience and members offered help on any any part of the e-portfolio where one felt lacking. Personally I feel I have grown, a lot of work and effort has been put into the module. This is the final unit and looking bad I feel I have gained a lot of extensive knowledge. This unit has also taught me a different perspective on the future of the internet. The various presentations made me rethink what I thought the internet was based on and reconsider the evolutions and the new technologies coming up. Is the future of the internet really changing? Yes it is, with IPv4 running out of IP addresses, this goes to show how much proliferation is happenning.<br />
