										<h2>UNIT 1 - History and Definitions</h2>
									</header> 
									<p>This is the introductory module which introduced us to the basics of Information security management. Through the lecturecast, I got to understand what constitues a threat and vulnerability as well as roles within the information security profession. We were put into groups which we are expected to work with until the end of the module. There was a discussion about the medical mannequin which I also had to read and post an initial summary relating to that. I had to identify threats and vulnerabilities and how these can be mitigated. It was so insightful as it introduced me to various aspects of securing network and information. Take a look at the link below as it takes you to the initial post i made.<br />
